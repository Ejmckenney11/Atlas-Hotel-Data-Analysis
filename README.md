PROJECT OVERVIEW

Atliq Grands, a distinguished player in the hospitality sector with an illustrious 20-year history, is currently facing challenges in maintaining its market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels segment. This decline can be attributed to both strategic maneuvers by competitors and inefficiencies in managerial decision-making.
In response to these challenges, the Managing Director of Atliq Grands has identified the integration of "Business and Data Intelligence" as a pivotal strategy to regain lost ground and drive revenue growth. However, the organization lacks an in-house data analytics team capable of providing the necessary insights.
Consequently, the revenue management team has initiated plans to engage a third-party service provider to extract insights from the company's extensive historical data. This partnership aims to leverage data analytics to inform strategic decisions and optimize performance in the luxury/business hotels segment.
